"There's free access to knives at the cafeteria""The Nescafé Alegria machine located in the kitchenette dispenses drinks at temperatures between 75°C and 92°C.The human eye can sustain a first-degree burn from liquid at 60°C in under five seconds.""A standard office stapler can fasten up to 20 sheets of paper with approximately 11 kilograms of pressure.
The human stomach can usually tolerate small foreign objects, but it doesn’t take many staples to turn digestion into a medical emergency.""The overhead light bulbs emit a constant, sterile glow rated at 4000 Kelvin for optimal productivity.
Human skin blisters instantly when exposed to the superheated liquid inside a ruptured bulb; eyes rupture faster.""The HermanMiller office chair is engineered to recline up to 135 degrees for ergonomic spinal support.
The human neck, when forced beyond 130 degrees, can suffer cervical dislocation, often resulting in paralysis or sudden death.""Whiteboard markers in the meeting room contain xylene-based solvents for fast-drying ink.
Brain tissue begins to deteriorate when exposed to high concentrations of xylene, disrupting normal brain function and oxygen utilization.""The refrigerator in the cafeteria uses insulated, pressure-sealed doors that can exert over 100 kilograms of closing force to maintain optimal internal conditions.  
The average adult skull can fracture under a pressure of approximately 100 to 200 kilograms.""The microwave in the cafeteria can heat contents to well over 100°C in under a minute.
Human tissue begins to cook at just over 44°C, given enough time and the absence of moisture.""Water is readily available throughout the facility to support hydration. 
Consumption exceeding 3 to 4 liters within a short timeframe, in under two hours, may result in water intoxication (hyponatremia), where blood sodium levels drop below safe levels.""The emergency exit staircase spans 8 floors, with 11 steps per floor. The vertical rise between each step is approximately the height of a human fist.

A body thrown from the top would make repeated contact with each step, resulting in multiple fractures, internal injuries, and likely fatal trauma by the time it reaches the bottom.""The decorative rocks found in the cafeteria are called Granite. They may contain trace amounts of naturally occurring radioactive elements such as uranium, thorium, and radon.
The human body, when exposed to elevated levels of radon gas released from certain granite surfaces over extended periods, may face an increased risk of respiratory irritation, cellular damage, and long-term carcinogenic effects.""The service elevator’s stainless steel surfaces trap heat, causing ambient temperatures to reach up to 50°C.
Exposure to an environment of 50°C for a duration exceeding 30 minutes may result in hyperthermia, respiratory distress, confusion, and hallucinations.""Sugar is available in multiple areas of the building.
When inserted in the ear, sugar dissolves slowly, altering the local pH and disrupting microbial balance. This may lead to infection, fermentation, and inner ear irritation. Prolonged exposure can result in lasting damage to auditory structures and may cause irreversible hearing loss.""Puzzles are a fun way to make your brain work. 
Creating a puzzle site during work hours, might lead to delay in finishing tasks."
